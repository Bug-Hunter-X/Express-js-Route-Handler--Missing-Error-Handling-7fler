# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to properly handle database errors and cases where a requested user is not found.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

**Bug:**
The original code lacks error handling for database errors and the scenario where a user with the specified ID does not exist.

**Solution:**
The solution includes checks for database errors and missing users, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (500 for server errors, 404 for not found) and informative error messages.
